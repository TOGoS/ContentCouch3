#+TITLE: ContentCouch3

A re-implementation of parts of [[https://github.com/TOGoS/ContentCouch/][ContentCouch]] with newer technologies, such as static typing.

Initially a collection of tools to fill gaps in ContentCouch functionality.
Hope is that it can eventually replace it completely.

Build with ~make~.  The JDK and basic shell commands should be the only prerequisite.
Depended-on libraries are either downloaded automatically using ~TJFetcher.jar~
or included (in ~ext-lib~) and maintained as Git subtrees.
