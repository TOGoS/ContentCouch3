- "-upload-queue-size 99999" option to upload
  so that slow servers don't prevent indexer from finishing or fast
  servers from being uploaded to
- ```upload -recurse``` doesn't seem to work; e.g.
  was trying to upload wedding pix with ```ccouch3 upload -recurse -http-server:piccouch piccouch.appspot.com -command-server:zappie1 ssh tog@zappie1.nuke24.net 'ccouch3 cmd-server -sector '\''pictures'\''' ';' -command-server:fs.marvin ssh tog@fs.marvin.nuke24.net 'ccouch3 cmd-server -sector '\''pictures'\''' ';' urn:bitprint:6W4PVKPFENWMOKGXCTD5I7WVTFE7NDIG.BTJTX7P4CC4UXLEZH3CL6K5PAW37NLUICWYMZUY```
  but it wasn't recursing!
- support x-ccouch-head URIs as command-line arguments
  to 'id', 'upload', 'download' (and any others where they are applicable)

- When -n (name) is given, report that instead of path in log
- When -m and/or -a are given, create a commit and log its URN in addition or in place of the file URN 

* Online help text
* Upload to multiple servers at once
