#+TITLE: ContentCouch3 to-do list

* Bugs

** ```upload -recurse``` doesn't seem to work

e.g. was trying to upload wedding pix with
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ccouch3 upload -recurse -http-server:piccouch piccouch.appspot.com \
  -command-server:zappie1 ssh tog@zappie1.nuke24.net 'ccouch3 cmd-server -sector '\''pictures'\''' ';' \
  -command-server:fs.marvin ssh tog@fs.marvin.nuke24.net 'ccouch3 cmd-server -sector '\''pictures'\''' ';' \
  urn:bitprint:6W4PVKPFENWMOKGXCTD5I7WVTFE7NDIG.BTJTX7P4CC4UXLEZH3CL6K5PAW37NLUICWYMZUY
#+END_SRC

but it wasn't recursing!

** ccouch3-cache has some issues

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
until ccouch3-cache -sector pictures -recurse \
  urn:bitprint:Q6BPLTU7V6343HKVNOVPO6HB3VQZZC77.B23Q74BEQAGIN4GJGCAC32EJ6OEWQL4LRTFA2TY
do
    echo "Maybe next time"
done
#+END_SRC

Different numbers of resources failing to cache each time; sometimes
17, sometimes 27, sometimes 28.  Wth.
