Version: 3.7.0
Date: 2023-12-28
JAR: urn:bitprint:RUDHX7A6M5JXMJCM4WMN27C4QRT6YILI.4EUW4NQT7FP7NYM3CGNKXJKVFWLMKCHS6WDU36I
Features:
  - Add 'walk-fs' subcommand, which is sort of experimental and not super useful yet.
  - Note that walk-fs will try to use the Windows `fsutil` command to get the 'file key'
    for each file.  On other systems it should get inode instead, but this isn't yet
    implemented.
