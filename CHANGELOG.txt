Version: 3.7.2
Date: 2024-05-18
JAR: urn:bitprint:TDTMA3W4TFXUTM33GEKYRLSIEXMXZ73G.LET3WDPEBIWS74VHQU4PZC6P4B6ELTDYQJJX5IY
Features:
  - Add `find-files` subcommand, which is rather over-engineered inside,
    the result being that it supports custom format strings.
  - `walk-fs` command defaults to outputting in the TSVFileManifestV1 format
Changes:
  - `backup` subcommand will use `CCOUCH_REPO_DIR` if it exists
  - Default repository dir/name is now derived from CCOUCH_REPO_DIR, CCOUCH_REPO_NAME
    rather than the lowercase versions, in line with what I've been saying
    for a while in https://github.com/TOGoS/ContentCouchRepositoryFormat

Version: 3.7.0
Date: 2023-12-28
JAR: urn:bitprint:RUDHX7A6M5JXMJCM4WMN27C4QRT6YILI.4EUW4NQT7FP7NYM3CGNKXJKVFWLMKCHS6WDU36I
Features:
  - Add `walk-fs` subcommand, which is sort of experimental and not super useful yet.
  - Note that walk-fs will try to use the Windows `fsutil` command to get the 'file key'
    for each file.  On other systems it should get inode instead, but this isn't yet
    implemented.

  - Additional debug messages from FlowUploader relating to FullyStoredMarkers
