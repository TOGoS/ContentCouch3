== Direct uploader architecture ==

Several parallel processes:

Process 1 (tree builder):
  Walk through directory tree hashing files and directories.
  Skip over files and directories thare are marked as already backed up.
  Pass names and hashes of files and directories that may be new onto process 2
  along with messages indicating to 'mark tree X as fully stored' (after
  all blobs comprising the tree have been passed).
  When an entire named tree (identified by a path given by the user, which there
  might be several) has been identified, pass the identifier to process 4.
  Send DONE marker to processes 2 and 4 and exit.

Process 2 (uploaded checker):
  For each hashed blob, ask the server if it has it already.
  Pass the hashes that the server does not already have on to process 3,
  along with 'mark tree X as fully stored' as completed messages.
  When the DONE message is received, pass it on to process 3 and exit.

Process 3 (uploader):
  Upload blobs passed from process 2 and act on 'mark tree X as fully stored'
  messages.  Exit when the DONE message is received, exit.

Process 4 (root logger):
  Write root paths + identifiers to log file.
  Exit when DONE marker is received.

Main program kicks off all processes and waits for them all to exit.
